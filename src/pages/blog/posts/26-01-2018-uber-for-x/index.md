### Uber for X, Netflix for Y
This last year has been a blur. At the start of 2017 I was working as an HVAC Service Engineer and by the end of 2017, I moved onto software development. Despite the massive change, I’ve learned a lot from both jobs about being a better engineer and product lead.

Over the last couple of months, I've experienced something fairly new to me. Customers that have the naive sense of building the next Twitter or Uber for a couple thousand dollars in a span of a few months.

I'm not going to expand on market viability, that's a whole other conversation but instead, focus on design and development. 

### The Hidden costs of solving really hard problems
I have often left our office feeling pretty shit. I constantly ask myself: "Have I done enough today ?". I’ve come to accept this as a normal feeling to have because I’m always pushing myself to build something valuable, question norms, and create the best value for our customers at Surge. Part of getting there is constantly feeling like it's never enough and there is always more to be done.

I understand our customers might not appreciate the laborious process it takes to get there but it's our responsibility to explain that process. We believe that ultimately if you want to add value to your customers and you care about the success of the product you've got answer some really tough questions.

#### 2. Design 
What does it mean to visualize a design via a wireframe and build a design prototype? 
Don't let designers just work out of the abstract, have you thought about your user's entire experience? From the moment they sign in to the moment they exit the app. You don't have to be an artist to sketch some basic box-like wireframes and map out a basic journey your users would go through. We think it's important you think this through and try to sketch or document some part of it yourself. Why? 
You want to treat the process of creating an app like an experiment. Build incrementally and get as much feedback as humanly possible early in the process. Think of a design prototype as a neatly wrapped presentation of your app (made up of all your designed screens), the point of this prototype is to test things out as cheaply as we can, in front of real potential customers. We don't want to hand over a design to our engineers only to have it changed because we didn't think it through and test the experience.

#### 3. Own what you don't know - Development
Do you understand the technology stacks involved? Do you understand scalability?
Let’s be really kind here and assume you’ve built the app with the best possible technologies available, and your app works seamlessly (this is not reality, this is utopian thinking). Now you want to expand on a feature or add a new one, maybe even pivot the product to survive or capitalize on a market opportunity not seen before, what now? Has your code been created with the idea of scalability in mind? 
How would we go about implementing different kinds of A/B testing?

What if a new technology changes an app's experience, and you soon find yourself delivering a subpar outdated experience, can you adopt this new technology onto the product?
You may think you don't need to answer these questions now, but have you left yourself in a situation where it becomes very difficult to answer these in the future? Customers are spoilt for choice and you may be left competing for their attention with great apps like Instagram, Facebook, Uber etc. These companies have some of the best and brightest engineers and designers in the world. They've made it seem simple, but it's not. There's a lot going on behind the scenes and you are being really naive thinking you can replicate their products for $10,000 in 3 months.

#### Be part of the journey to solutions, don't just expect the solution
If your business revolves around an app that is crappy, slow or just has a plain shitty user experience you are not going to entice users to get on it. If you expect your development of software to be some one-stop-shop solution taken care of by the 'development firm' you are likely setting yourself up for failure.

Talk to your design and development teams and be an active part of the development process. We can't stress this enough - care about the software you are building! Learn, test and understand what makes great software.
Understand your developers aren't robots, and having to rebuild the same components over and over again because of some aesthetic change that should have been tested in the design prototype is a loss in productivity, they could instead be focused on solving hard problems and taking the product forward. Be part of those conversations, you'll be proud of what you're building.
