### My transition into software development.

# 

About 3 years ago I decided to acquire the right set of skills and experience to begin a transition into software development.

At the time I worked as an HVAC service engineer on industrial chillers. My job was basically ensuring all pre-commissioning conditions were met prior to installing the equipment I was meant to maintain. I was one of two Melbourne trained engineers in Sri Lanka for the SMARDT chiller brand. The company produced the most sophisticated industrial chiller at the time, an oil-free magnetic bearing chiller - capable of handling large heating loads very effectively all while producing revolutionary energy savings because of its radical new technology.

My strength came from being able to narrow down and solve problems during the event of the equipment failing, underperforming and pre-commissioning. I really enjoyed that aspect of the job, breaking down a complex problem by following a process of testing one component and then another. This industrial equipment was incredibly expensive, and there was a lot riding on my shoulders when we commissioned them at some of Sri Lanka's leading hotels and apparel manufacturers factories etc. But almost always, our customers were incredibly happy with my transparency and maintenance of the project and I felt good about the work I did.

Two years into the job, it felt a bit repetitive. Our business had slowed down, the recent change in the political climate in the country had a drastic effect on the sale of our product. My favorite part of my job was analyzing the data generated by these machines. Essentially the control of the equipment via the software is what gave our equipment an edge over competitors products, it's ability to control cooling output according to demand at incredible accuracy intrigued me and so began my journey into the understanding of software.

It hit me, software is the future. I'll get into the specifics into how I learned to programme in another post. I felt like I had to be part of this technological revolution. I kept hearing about open source frameworks,  the impact of the smartphone and apps on traditional businesses etc and cloud platforms that offer incredible infrastructure at the cost of a few dollars a month.

In the context of my job I began to understand how automating equipment using software is the direction, it will head in and I wanted to learn the right skills to be ready for when that happens, not just look at what seems like the future and just watch it pass by. I decided I was going to understand what it meant to write software.

I had taken years after my A levels to decide on what I wanted to do, to the frustration of my parents I still didn't have the right answer at 23, but being good Asian parents they were happy I was involved in Mechanical Engineering, telling them I had an interest to switch to software didn't seem like a good idea. I strategized my next move, I decided I was going to do a ton of research and I was going to use the internet to learn what I needed to (I love self-learning and used it before to learn all sorts of skills - from electric guitar to composing electronic music etc). Now I was gonna find out what it meant to write code. 

Little did I know I was beginning a liberating professional journey where I had stumbled upon a job with the right mix of passion and opportunity, where I would combine a hard work ethic into something I would become genuinely passionate about and hopefully get very good at it.
